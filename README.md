## Introduction

D'Cipher helps users to share their sensitive information with control.

Sending sensitive information like **credit card details**, with any online medium is risky these days. We have to trust the medium with our information. :confused:
Some platforms provide end to end encryption or auto destroy text sharing, but we have to trust them anyway.
Here comes The **DCipher**. You don't need to trust anybody, create your own secret key and encrypt text with it and share the text and key with different platforms like sending **Secret Key  on Whatsapp** and **Encrypted Text on Telegram**. You are in control now. :smiley: :v:
You have to share key only once and send multiple secret text receiver. :key:
